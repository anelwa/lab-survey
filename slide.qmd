## Google Forms

[Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) is a survey administration software included as part of the free, web-based Google Docs Editors suite offered by Google. Google Forms is only available as a web application. 

The app allows us to create and edit surveys online while collaborating with other users in real-time. We use this service in our course.
